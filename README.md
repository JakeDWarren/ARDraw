# Firefly Farm

This application is a combination of device controls and media accessories. Firefly Farm has been design for use on mobiles (IOS Safari) and PC's with orientation controls e.g. Surface Pros'.
When using a mobile, this application is limited to just iPhones due to the current state of compatibility between browsers and WebRTC. WebRTC provides JavaScript access to things like the device camera and microphone.


## What is Firefly Farm...

At its core, Firefly Farm is an example of a first person shooter type platform. Instead of shooting people the goal is to kill as many fire flies as you can, however, if you miss a firefly then the game becomes harder by adding another firefly to the scene. Addition features include the use of a marker which will give the viewer access to a firefly being born and released into the world in through more AR technology.

## How to play...

After agreeing to let Firefly Farm use your camera, you...
 - Read the intro screen and select 'PLAY FIREFLY FARM'
	 - The option to save and download the marker for print is also available.
 - Then you must look around the scene to locate your first firefly.
 - Once found, you must accurate press 'Fire' whist your scope(white circle) is aimed at the firefly.
 - The firefly will explode and you kill counter will go up whilst your fireflies left counter will go down.
 - If you miss too much and the game seems impossible to win then just select 'Reset' to return to the start of your level
 - If you wish to see a firefly be born then simply hover over the marker and click 'Fire'.
 - Once you kill all the fireflies in Level 1 then you commence onto level to which is twice as hard (2 x More Fireflies).
